      Welcome to this ERC-721 UX project. The goal of this project is to provide
      a simple and easy to use interface for ERC-721 tokens. This project is
      still in development and is not ready for production use. <br /><br />Note
      that you had to connect your wallet to use this app and to switch to the
      Sepolia testnet. This is because all the tokens are minted on the Sepolia
      testnet. All the tokens featured in this app are fake and have no value,
      they were created for testing purposes by our teacher.
